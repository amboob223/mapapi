go on map box and make an account and use the dev toops in the inspectt to go to senesors thats how you change location 
and the navigator api gives current location info navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(successLocation, errorLocation, {
    enableHighAccuracy: true
});
you got to go where it say integrate map box
to get the components api makers and controls like navogtaor control
